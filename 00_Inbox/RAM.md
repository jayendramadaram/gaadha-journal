MIXNET goals for today

- basic perfection
	-  [x] relayer mode
	-  [x] single exit node mode
- migration (brainstorm here)
	- we will pack mixnet node properly first
	- then we will seperate darkpool client and mixnet client
	- build mixnet client - test all web2 calls reads and writes 
	- fixes to fragmenter etc etc do a personal audit
	- then work on darkpool client which uses normal mode and mixnet mode as well
		- this will be later used in solvers as well
	- work on complete end to end integration 
- bench mark entire mixnet in and out -  without web3 calls btw (web3 calls is just a added feature)
- go ahead and build and work on blog

lets manually audit codebase first


things to fix in nox mixnet
- local mesh is wrong
- benches are not sufficient
- data directory for sled, some day we should clean temp directory
- price server and price client must be used in real world testing and scenario

client issues
- is fragmentation happening correct ?
- whats the max payload we can send from client side with current code, and whats the max payload we can recieve from the mixnet
