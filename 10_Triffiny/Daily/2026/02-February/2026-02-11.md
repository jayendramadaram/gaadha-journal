-  this dude is good, he uses stink bidding (basically orders that go deep in the orderbook, and instantly unwind your positions with a profit or hedge somewhere else.) - strategy is risky regarding how deep your orders sit in the orderbook, the volatility and liquidity of your asset and any tail risk such as news, rug etc which makes this kind of strategy really profitable, but carries a huge risk.
- I feel like this is gambling dressed up as a strategy lol, maybe he is making good money so according to me any strategy which has probability greater than a coin flip + no fee's, then it is not gambling but yeah we will see we will see 



we should see whats gives this guy those balls

when we have time, we will explore prediction marks from that discord server and text vipen about wazzup


I love this guys game, we should try it,

[this guy](https://armv7l.substack.com/p/the-day-i-turned-100-to-11k-in-30?triedRedirect=true)  was scouting thin liquidity low market making orderbooks, he found MYRO token which had one MM, and a weird bot, which mirror trades and farms tokens, so when btc was crashing and MYRO still had thin liquidity, all the stop losses triggered and position hodlers, market makers and other bots started aggresively selling, 

so he saw an oppertunity and in 30 seconds he placed HFT trades at lot lot below the Index price, all of them got filled because since btc was crasshing and other big bots wanted to liquidate ASAP. so they took his order which was far far below than index price, once his buy orders executed, he put sell orders 1 tick below the index price. this time cross exchange arbitrage bots picked up his bots and full filled them, he turned 100 dollars to 11k

Good story kada, often exchanges halt and mark or wont allow such exploiters, but he was also registered as market maker in the exchange, so win win for him he exited easily, we should try this some time. for sure.

_ I just realised three body problem is fucking huge of a scene, as of yesterday or recent days, entire wall street uses black shores algorithm (inspired from spread of heat in metals), but they realised that voltility in black shores algorithm is not constant, and it plays a huge role in this liquidity markets, or not so huge commodities markets, so since there is no equation or mathematical representation for three body problem we dont have one for this too, lol - wall street is building deep neural nets (prolly in production) for solving three body problem like scenes in stock market, thats huge lol. So if three body problem ever gets solved we should be the first one to port it into finance markets
