# BRAINSTORM
-----------

- I did initial proper setup of obsidian nothing else needed at the moment things look good
- I will have to complete mixnet at any cost today
- I should also read a bit
- I should also find one good desktop bot for me


lets do one thing
- we will let claude bots run, in mean time we will find a perfect windows bot for us.

what shall we write in gaadha ?
- life in kondapur
- something from what I read - from intel and skill
- about mixnets




so lets kick in our research about which desktop ai is best, babe I wanna play soccar with you someday, I will be waiting for that day

it will come in near 6 months trust me,


ok lets continue our research

this is the prompt I am gonna run

You are an expert AI researcher and automation specialist with up-to-date knowledge as of February 2026. Your responses are evidence-based, citing recent benchmarks (e.g., OSWorld, UI Grounding), real-user reports, and tool documentation where possible.

I am looking for the most reliable, state-of-the-art desktop AI agent that can autonomously perform multi-step tasks on a Windows PC by directly controlling the desktop environment (e.g., mouse clicks, keyboard input, screen reading, opening/closing apps, draggin, painting, etc navigating UI elements).

Specific example tasks I want it to handle reliably:
- Open VS Code, install a specific extension from the marketplace, then close it.
- Open VLC media player, load a video file, perform basic editing/trimming if possible, save changes, and close the app.
- Open a browser, navigate to a site, perform actions (e.g., login, fill forms), then close all tabs.
- General chores: Organize files in Explorer, rename batches of files, take screenshots, run system maintenance, or chain multiple apps together.

Key requirements:
- High reliability (low failure rate on multi-step tasks, good error recovery).
- Native or strong Windows support.
- Ability to handle visual UI elements (not just code execution or browser-only).
- I'm open to any setup: local/offline, cloud/API-based, adding tools/hooks/skills/MCPs, custom integrations, or hybrid.

Past experience: I tried a Claude-based desktop setup with multiple MCP connectors (e.g., Windows MCP, Context7, browser search, and many others), but it was unreliable and frequently failed on basic tasks.

My resources:
- Subscriptions: Claude (max $100 tier), Google AI Pro, ChatGPT (likely Plus/Team), Grok (via X Premium).
- Can obtain additional API keys: Free tiers from Groq, OpenRouter, etc.
- Hardware: High-end Windows desktop – RTX 4090 GPU, Ryzen 9 9800X3D CPU, 64GB RAM, 2TB storage. Fully capable of running large local multimodal models (e.g., via Ollama, LM Studio) at high speed.

Task: Recommend the top 3 best options available in February 2026 that fit my needs best.

For each recommendation:
1. Name the tool/agent/framework (e.g., Open Interpreter OS Mode, Claude Cowork, OpenAI Operator, Microsoft Fara-7B, etc.).
2. Why it's superior to my previous Claude MCP setup (address reliability issues).
3. Pros/cons, especially reliability, Windows support, local vs. cloud, cost, and privacy.
4. Setup steps (concise, step-by-step, including any required models/APIs leveraging my hardware/subscriptions).
5. Estimated success rate on my example tasks (based on benchmarks or reports).
6. Any tips to maximize reliability.

Present your reasoning step-by-step first, then output the recommendations in a clear table format, followed by your #1 overall pick for me and why.

Do not recommend anything outdated or browser-only if it can't handle full desktop control.

Note: I am also open to llm council like models, like running a low capable model locally which will orchestrate all tools and my pc in and out.

well lol babe with just one query i realised either we should be running a super intelligent model locally or pay for api subscriptions, pay per use ones

which is not gonna happen today, 

cool lets go to next tasks which is 
- intelligence
- skill
- strategic
- and body

we will go through 
- emails
- twitter
- medium
- substack

in this batch, lets start with twitter


there is a cool research tool we should try it out someday
https://github.com/virattt/dexter


babe lol this twitter kind of makes me nervous lol, a lot is happening in twitter and I feel like i am behind

	fuck no, we will win it all


lets check our emails I am pretty sure we will have some good content in there

we have some tasks now

# MISSION CONTROL: 2026-02-09

## STATUS HUD
```dataviewjs
// --- CONFIGURATION: SCORING RULES ---
const page = dv.current();
const tasks = page.file.tasks;

// Rule 1: Physiology (Must complete 'Physiology' to get points)

const strat = tasks.filter(t => t.text.includes("Strategy") && t.completed).length > 0 ? 10 : 0;

// Rule 3: Intelligence (If ANY sub-task like Twitter/Scholar is done, get 10 pts)
// We look for tasks under the Intelligence header section (approximate logic)

const intel = intelTasks.length >= 2 ? 10 : (intelTasks.length >= 1 ? 5 : 0); // 10pts for 2+, 5pts for 1

// CALCULATION
const auto_score = physio + strat + intel + skill + build + record;
